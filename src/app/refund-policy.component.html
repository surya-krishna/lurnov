            <p class="text-lg">Thank you for subscribing to Lurnov. Please read our refund policy carefully before
                making any purchase.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Strict No Refund Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>All sales are final.</strong> Due to the digital nature of our products and the immediate access
                granted to our premium features and AI content upon purchase, we do not offer refunds, returns, or
                exchanges for any subscription plans or one-time purchases.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Subscription Cancellations</h2>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Upon cancellation:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>Your premium access will continue until the end of your current billing cycle.</li>
                <li>You will not be charged for the next billing cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>No pro-rated refunds</strong> will be issued for the remaining unused portion of your
                    subscription term.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Free Trials</h2>
            <p>If you signed up for a free trial, you must cancel before the trial period ends to avoid being charged.
                Once the trial ends and the payment is processed, the standard No Refund Policy applies.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Technical Issues</h2>
            <p>We are committed to providing a high-quality service. If you experience technical issues that prevent you
                from using the Service, please contact our support team immediately. However, the existence of a
                technical issue does not automatically entitle you to a refund. We reserve the right to attempt to
                resolve the issue first.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Exceptions</h2>
            <p>Refunds are granted solely at the absolute discretion of Lurnov management and only in exceptional
                circumstances (e.g., duplicate charges due to a system error). Any such refund does not constitute a
                waiver of this policy for future instances.</p>
