      <p>Every parent wants to see their child thrive in school, but with busy schedules and ever-changing curriculums, staying involved can feel overwhelming. The good news? You don’t need to be a subject expert or have hours of free time to make a real difference. Here are five heartfelt, practical ways to stay engaged in your child’s learning journey—and help them shine, both in and out of the classroom.</p>
      <hr class="my-6 border-accent/30">

      <section class="flex items-start gap-4 my-10">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-primary text-white flex items-center justify-center text-xl font-bold shadow-md">1</div>
        <div>
          <div class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl text-primary mb-2">Create a Positive Learning Environment at Home</div>
          <p>Children flourish in spaces where they feel safe, supported, and inspired. Set up a cozy, distraction-free study nook—maybe a corner of the living room or a spot by the window. Add a comfy chair, good lighting, and a few of your child’s favorite things. Even a small gesture, like a handwritten note of encouragement on their desk, can make homework time feel special.</p>

        <div>
          <div class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl text-primary mb-2">Keep the Conversation Going with Teachers</div>
          <p>Teachers are your partners in your child’s education. Don’t hesitate to reach out—whether it’s a quick email, a chat at pickup, or attending school events. Ask about your child’s strengths, challenges, and how you can support learning at home. When your child sees you and their teacher working together, it sends a powerful message: their education matters.</p>

          <div class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl text-primary mb-2">Spark Curiosity Beyond the Classroom</div>
          <p>Learning doesn’t stop when the bell rings. Ask open-ended questions about what your child is exploring at school. Take a walk and talk about nature, cook together and discuss measurements, or watch a documentary as a family. Show genuine interest, and let your child teach you something new—they’ll love being the expert!</p>

        <div>
          <div class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl text-primary mb-2">Support Healthy Habits for Mind and Body</div>
          <p>Academic success is built on a foundation of healthy routines. Encourage regular sleep, nutritious meals, and movement breaks. Celebrate effort, not just results—praise your child for sticking with a tough assignment or trying a new approach. Remind them (and yourself!) that mistakes are part of learning and growth.</p>

          <div class="font-extrabold text-xl md:text-2xl text-primary mb-2">Celebrate Progress, Big and Small</div>
          <p>Every step forward deserves recognition. Did your child finish a challenging project? Master a new skill? Show appreciation with words, a high-five, or a special family treat. Your encouragement fuels their motivation and builds resilience for future challenges.</p>

      <hr class="my-6 border-accent/30">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">You’re Their Biggest Cheerleader</h2>
      <p>Remember, your involvement doesn’t require perfection—just presence and positivity. By showing up, asking questions, and celebrating the journey, you’re giving your child the greatest gift: the confidence to believe in themselves. Here’s to learning, growing, and thriving—together!</p>
